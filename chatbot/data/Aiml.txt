# ðŸ¤– Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning (AIML)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn. Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.

## ðŸ“š Key Topics in AIML

### ðŸ”¢ Supervised Learning
Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset. Common algorithms include:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)

### ðŸ“Š Unsupervised Learning
Used when the data has no labels. Algorithms include:
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- DBSCAN

### ðŸŽ° Reinforcement Learning (RL)
An agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment:
- Q-Learning
- Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
- Policy Gradient Methods
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
Applications include robotics, gaming, and finance.

### ðŸ§  Deep Learning (DL)
A subfield of ML that uses neural networks with many layers:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image tasks
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and LSTMs for sequences
- Transformers for text and language (like ChatGPT)
- Autoencoders for compression and generation

## ðŸ§¬ Generative AI (GenAI)
GenAI involves systems that generate new content: text, images, code, music, and more.
- GPT, BERT (language models)
- DALLÂ·E, Stable Diffusion (image generation)
- MusicLM, Jukebox (music)
- Codex, Copilot (code generation)
